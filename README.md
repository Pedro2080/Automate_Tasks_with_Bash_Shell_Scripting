###           Linux: Permissions Fixing
**3-** Complete the file stub “/home/joao/Documents/Automate_Tasks_with_Bash_Shell_Scripting/Exercise_03.sh” with one or more steps
that do the following:

- Extract the archive “/home/joao/Documents/Automate_Tasks_with_Bash_Shell_Scripting/archive.tar.gz”.
- Set permission “0664” for all the extracted files.
- Set permission “0775” for all the extracted folders.
- Set the owner to “nobody” and the group to “nogroup“ for all the extracted files 
and folders.
- From all the fixed files and folders, create, a new archive named 
“/tmp/archive.tar.gz”. <br />
**Note:**
- The completed solution will be evaluated in a new clean environment. Be sure 
everything is in the “/home/joao/Documents/Automate_Tasks_with_Bash_Shell_Scripting” folder.
- All the tasks should be done within a simple “sudo solve” execution invoked from 
the question directory.
  - Use sudo access.
  
**4-** Write a bash script that prints names of all files from the current directory which
content (not name) does not contain any digit.<br />
**5-** Write a script which counts how many environment variables are defined in the system.

**6-** Write a script, which reads a file with numbers and finds a minimum, a maximum and a sum of values from the file. 
The numbers in the file must be placed in separated rows.
If the file is empty, then the proper message should be printed.

**7-** Write a script that takes three arguments: INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE1, OUTPUT_FILE2.
All even numbers from INPUT_FILE would be written to OUTPUT_FILE1 and odd numbers to OUTPUT_FILE2.
The script will display how many numbers are in both output files and how many words from the file were not a number.
